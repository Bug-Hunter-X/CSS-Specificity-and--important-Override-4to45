The solution involves understanding and adjusting CSS specificity.  Instead of relying on `!important`, refactor the CSS to ensure the desired styles are applied with more specific and well-structured selectors.

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container div {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 14px;
}

.container p:first-of-type {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.container .special-paragraph {
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

By adding a class `special-paragraph` to the `<p>` element within the `<div>`, we create a more specific selector to target that element precisely. This avoids the need for `!important` and improves CSS maintainability and readability.
